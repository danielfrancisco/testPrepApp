⚠️ Note on API Response Time

⏳ Cold Start Warning (Render Free Tier):
This server is hosted on Render.com using the free tier, which automatically puts the service to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity.

When the service is "asleep," the first request (e.g., login, account creation, data fetch) will experience a cold start delay of 30–120 seconds.

Subsequent requests will be fast once the service is warmed up.
